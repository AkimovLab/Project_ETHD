# Entangled Trajectories Hamiltonian Dynamics for Treating Quantum Nuclear Effects

SI-Classical_N_1000 - simulation of an ensemble of N = 1000 classical trajectories
SI-ETHD_N_1000 - simulation of an ensemble of N = 1000 trajectories trajectories coupled via the entangled trajectories Hamiltonian.

In all cases, the evolution of the probability density in the phase space is shown
